Assignment Instructions.

1. 	Read the instructions in the lab book.

2.	Select ONE of the attached projects and use the supplied content to first design and then make a web site.

3.	On every page there must be a disclaimer which contains the following text:

"This website was created for a University project. The content is largely fictional and no services are actually being offered."

4.	Some images are supplied which you may use. If you wish to use others make sure you attribute them as specified in the lab book - or create them yourself.

5.	If you really want to make a web site with your own content that's fine; just check with Nick first.
