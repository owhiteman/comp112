		<p>Translated by George Fyler Townsend</p>
		<h2>The Wolf and the Lamb</h2>
		<p>WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
			lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the
			Lamb the Wolf's right to eat him.  He thus addressed him:
			"Sirrah, last year you grossly insulted me."  "Indeed," bleated
			the Lamb in a mournful tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
			said the Wolf, "You feed in my pasture."  "No, good sir," replied
			the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted grass."  Again said the Wolf,
			"You drink of my well."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
			drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food and drink
			to me."  Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
			"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every
			one of my imputations."
		</p>
		<p class="meaning">The tyrant will always find a pretext for
			his tyranny.
		</p>
		<h2>The Bat and the Weasels</h2>
		<p>A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded
		to be spared his life.  The Weasel refused, saying that he was by
		nature the enemy of all birds.  The Bat assured him that he was
		not a bird, but a mouse, and thus was set free.  Shortly
		afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by
		another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.  The
		Weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice.  The Bat
		assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second
		time escaped.
		<p>
		<p class="meaning">It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.</p>
		<h2>The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller</h2>
		<p>A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house.  One day
			he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live
			with him, saying that they should be far better neighbors and
			that their housekeeping expenses would be lessened.  The Fuller
			replied, "The arrangement is impossible as far as I am concerned,
			for whatever I should whiten, you would immediately blacken again
			with your charcoal."
		</p>
		<p class="meaning">Like will draw like. </p>
		<h2>The Wolf and the Crane</h2>
		<p>A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a
			large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone.
			When the Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised
			payment, the Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed:
			"Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense, in
			having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the
			mouth and jaws of a wolf."
		</p>
		<p class="meaning">In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you
			escape injury for your pains.
		</p>
		<h2>The Hare and the Tortoise</h2>
		<p>A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
			Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
			wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
			assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
			they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
			goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
			together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
			with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course.
			The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep.  At last
			waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
			had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her
			fatigue.
		</p>
		<p class="meaning">Slow but steady wins the race. </p>
