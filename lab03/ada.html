		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<figure><img src="lovelace.jpg" width="187" height="237" alt="Ada Lovelace."></figure>
		<p>Ada Lovelace is best known as the world's first computer programmer. In conjunction with Charles Babbage she developed concepts and theories directly applicable to the modern computer. What makes Lovelace's foresight and vision with regard to computing technology even more remarkable is the fact that her intellectual pursuits conflicted with the perceived place of women in nineteenth century British society.
		</p>
		<p>In 1979, the United States Department of Defence introduced a new programming language they had developed. They called it 'Ada' in recognition of Lovelace's work 100 years earlier. The Ada language was designed for large scale programming of very complex software for which conditions may be changing and evolving, therefore requiring constant updating. In 1984, its use became mandatory for certain types of military software. Outside the military, its use is more limited but continues to grow (Eck 1995).

		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p>Augusta Ada Byron (known as Lady Lovelace after marriage) was born in London, England on the 10th of December, 1815. She was the daughter of the Romantic Poet, Lord Byron and Annabella Milbanke Byron. Soon after she was born her parents separated and her father left England forever.
		</p>
		<p>Lady Byron, Lovelace's mother did not want her to become a poet like her father, so she had her tutored in mathematics, astronomy and music (in addition to the usual subjects taught to young women of that time), in order to counteract any poetic tendencies.
		</p>
		<p>Lovelace had all the benefits of growing up in upper class London. She attended concerts, the theatre and elegant parties where she met many famous and influential people, including Charles Babbage, a Mathematics lecturer at Cambridge University (Maisel and Smart 1997).
		</p>
		<h3>The Computer</h3>
		<p>Charles Babbage first expressed the concept of a computer in 1834. His idea, based on Joseph-Marie Jacquard's Mechanical Loom (which used punch cards as a programme), was an Analytical Engine that could carry out any calculation to twenty digits (Beekman 1999). At the time, very few people, except Lovelace, supported his ideas. Lovelace had known Babbage for several years and was an avid admirer of his work. Babbage's ideas were radical for a time when the telephone had yet to be invented (see table 1 for this and other significant inventions of the time).
		</p>
		<p>In 1843, Babbage asked Lovelace to translate the Italian mathematician, L.F. Menebrea's description of Babbage's Analytical Engine from French to English and to add her own notes and mathematical solutions to it (Toole 1992).
		</p>
		<h3>Visionary</h3>
		<p>Lovelace's own annotations about the Analytical Engine, published in 1843, predict the uses and limitations of computers. Some of her predictions have come true, for example, she thought that in the future, machines would be able to produce graphics and compose complex music. Lovelace also devised 'programs' for the Analytical Engine and she noted its ability to store a program (a sequence of operations or instructions). Babbage's Analytical Engine therefore, had the attributes of a modern computer: an input device, a storage system, processing ability and an output device (Toole 1992). Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, and sufficiently advanced technology the Analytical Engine was never built, but Lovelace's ideas and foresight have been used and adapted in the creation of the modern computer (Beekman 1999).
		</p>
		<h3>"Enchantress of Numbers"</h3>
		<p>Lovelace was fascinated with mechanical things and loved to figure out how machines worked. This was an interest that developed at an early age; she is said to have designed a flying machine at the age of thirteen (Maisel and Smart 1997).
		</p>
		<p>She was a charming, but temperamental, aristocratic hostess, and mathematicians of the time thought her a magnificent addition to their number (Hyman 1996). This was at a time when the participation of noblewomen in intellectual pursuits was not widely encouraged (Maisel and Smart 1997).
		</p>
		<p>Lovelace's cerebral abilities and reputation amongst her intellectual peers was by no means typical for a woman in the nineteenth century. Lovelace's striking personality helped her break the norm of her day and develop theories that would not be fully appreciated for more than a century after her death.
		</p>
		<p>Three years after her marriage to William King in 1835, she became Countess of Lovelace when King inherited a noble title. They had three children but Lovelace's dominant mother controlled the children, the household and its fortunes (Maisel and Smart 1997). Despite the difficulties of such an arrangement, this gave Lovelace the freedom to pursue her interest in Babbage's Analytical Engine and her mathematical studies.
		</p>
		<p>When Lovelace began working with Babbage she started gambling on horse races in order to raise the money necessary for building the Analytical Engine. Consequently she was in debt for years; she even pawned family jewels to sustain what became an addiction to gambling (Beekman 1999).
		</p>
		<p>During her lifetime she was plagued with ill health and became addicted to opium and morphine as a result of her treatments. Once she overcame the addictions, she blamed her 'derangements' on 'too much mathematics' (Thornhill 1997). In 1852, at the age of 36, she died of cancer.
		</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>Lovelace was a woman before her time. Her achievements were remarkable considering that she was living in an age where women were generally not accepted within scientific circles. Her vivid imagination enabled her to envisage change and propose new ideas and concepts. The questions and concepts Lovelace proposed over one hundred years ago assisted greatly in the advancement of computer technology in the twentieth century.
