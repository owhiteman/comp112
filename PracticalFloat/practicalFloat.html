                <p>Tables existed in HTML for one reason: To display tabular data. But then border="0" made it possible for designers to have a grid upon which to lay out images and text. <em>Still the most dominant means of designing visually rich Web sites</em>, the use of tables is now actually interfering with building a better, more accessible, flexible, and functional Web. Find out where the problems stem from, and learn solutions to create transitional or completely table-less layout.

                <h2>The problem with using tables:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mixes presentational data in with your content.
                        <ul>
                            <li>This makes the file sizes of your pages unnecessarily large, as users must download this presentational data for each page they visit.
                            <li>Bandwidth ain't free.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This makes redesigns of existing sites and content extremely labor intensive (and expensive).</li>
                    <li>It also makes it extremely hard (and expensive) to maintain visual consistency throughout a site.</li>
                    <li>Table-based pages are also much less accessible to users with disabilities and viewers using cell phones and PDAs to access the Web.
                    </li>
